                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Duck"><em>Donald Duck</em></a> is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic
                    white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow
                    tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental
                    personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters
                    and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002.
                    He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic
                    book character in the world outside of the superhero genre.

                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"><em>giant panda</em></a> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, literally "black and white cat-foot"; Chinese: 大熊猫;
                    pinyin: dà xióng māo, literally "big bear cat"),[4] also known as panda bear or simply panda, is
                    a bear[5] native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black
                    patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is
                    sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order
                    Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo.[6] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally
                    eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity,
                    they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.

                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_badger"><em>honey badger</em></a> (Mellivora capensis), also known as the ratel (/ˈreɪtəl/ or /ˈrɑːtəl/) is the only
                    species in the mustelid subfamily Mellivorinae and its only genus Mellivora. It is native to Africa,
                    Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Despite its name, the honey badger does not closely
                    resemble other badger species; instead, it bears more anatomical similarities to weasels. It is
                    classed as Least Concern rather than a threatened species by the IUCN owing to its extensive range
                    and general environmental adaptations. It is primarily a carnivorous species and has few natural
                    predators because of its thick skin and ferocious defensive abilities.
