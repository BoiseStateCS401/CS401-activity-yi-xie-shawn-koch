      <h2>
         HTML
      </h2>
      <p>
         <Strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</Strong> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
         applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from
         local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
         page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
         HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
         objects, such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means
         to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
         paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
         using angle brackets.
         With <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em>, and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
         technologies for the World Wide Web.

      <h2>
         CSS
      </h2>
      <p>
         <strong>CSS</strong> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper,
         or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
         External stylesheets are stored in <em>CSS</em> files. More information please check: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" title="CSS Tutorial @ w3schools.com">CSS</a>

      <h2>
         JavaScript
      </h2>
      <p>
         <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based,
         multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core
         technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,
         including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need
         for plug-ins by means of a <em>built-in</em> JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different
         implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the
         spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.

            Which elements are block elements and which elements are inline? How do you know?
            <ul>
               <li>While in the Chrome page inspector, select "Elements" from the top menu bar and then "Styles" from the second-level menu.
                  You can then select elements of the html page and see if their display property = "block".  It looks like only the images are inline,
                  everything is block.

            </ul>

         <li>
            What is the default margin of the body element?

               <li>8 pixels</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            What are the default font-size and font-weight of the h1 element?
            <ul>
               <li>2em and Times New Roman</li>
            </ul>
         </li>

            How can you view the response status of the requested resources (e.g. images in this case)?
