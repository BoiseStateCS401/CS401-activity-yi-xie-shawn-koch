                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><em>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) </em></a>is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
                        applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from
                        local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
                        page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                        <strong>HTML</strong> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                        objects, such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means
                        to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
                        paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written
                        using angle brackets.

                        With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
                        technologies for the World Wide Web.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em></a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                        document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web
                        pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document,
                        including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.
                        Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create
                        visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many
                        mobile applications.

                        <Strong>CSS</Strong> is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation,
                        including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
                        accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
                        enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                        file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

                        Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different
                        styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
                        browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page
                        differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different
                        style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.

                        Changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly
                        and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.

                        The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more
                        than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities
                        (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.

                        In computing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"><em>JavaScript</em></a> is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
                        It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.Alongside HTML and CSS,
                        JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the
                        majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for
                        plug-ins.JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm
                        language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an
                        API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O,
                        such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment
                        in which it is embedded.

                        Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language
                        name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two are distinct languages and differ
                        greatly in their design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.

                        <strong>JavaScript</strong> is also used in environments that are not Web-based, such as PDF documents,
                        site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs)
                        and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side
                        Web applications. On the client side, developers have traditionally implemented JavaScript as
                        an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation. Programmers
                        also use JavaScript in video-game development, in crafting desktop and mobile applications, and
                        in server-side network programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.
