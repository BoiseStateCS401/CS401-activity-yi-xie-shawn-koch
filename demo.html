                        Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented
                        and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to
                        let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
                        can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications
                        are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of
                        computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
                        particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
                        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired
                        by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
                        The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

                            Which elements are block elements and which elements are inline? How do you know?
                            <ul>
                                <li>While in the Chrome page inspector, select "Elements" from the top menu bar and then "Styles" from the second-level menu.
                                    You can then select elements of the html page and see if their display property = "block".  It looks like only the images are inline,
                                    everything is block.

                            How can you view the response status of the requested resources (e.g. images in this case)?

                                <li>While in the Chrome page inspector, select "Network" from the top menu bar and click F5 to refresh.  The load time for each image will be displayed in the table.</li>
